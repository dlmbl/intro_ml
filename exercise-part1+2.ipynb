This notion is captured by a <em>loss function</em>, which compares model outputs and labels and produces a score telling us if the model did a \"good\" job or not on our given task. By convention, low values of the loss function's output (e.g. the loss) correspond to good performance and high values to bad performance. We also need an <em>optimization algorithm</em>, which is a set of rules for how to adjust the model parameters to reduce the loss\n",
